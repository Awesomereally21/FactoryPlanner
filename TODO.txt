TODO Features:
- Scaling
- Info pane with shortcuts / small Tutorial
- Make the Subfactory bar scalable (row-breakoff, multiple rows)
? Notes and/or custom tooltip text for subfactories


TODO Improvements:
? create testsuite for sprite+label-buttons
? more special characters for subfactory names
? error handling to prevent crashing the whole save
* subfactory_bar spacing is a super-mess on different resoultions and scaling modes,
    sprite resizing is also still not fixable, might need to reconsider

BUGS:
- actual Sprite size doesn't adjust to height and width, only it's 'box' does
    fix might be coming in 0.17
- not whole frame considered part of GuiElement, fires no on_gui_click event (see subfactory_dialog)

TODO 0.17:
- *.style.visible -> *.visible

TODO Post-Launch:
! Modules
! Energy consumption
- Export/Import
- Multiplayer
? FNEI Linking
? Power Planning


API Changes:
A let enter work as a way to submit forms, even when a textfield is in focus
- button with both sprite and text


MISC:
- Count LOC: ( find ./ -name '*.lua' -print0 | xargs -0 cat ) | wc -l
